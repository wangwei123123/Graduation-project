ww_shell                  Introduction Of The Program                 ww_shell

NAME
        ww_shell - The Custom Shell

COMMAND FORMAT
        command [options] [file]

DESCRIPTION
        ww_shell is a program that appears for graduation design. It implements
        a simple shell function, and on this basis, adds custom functions to 
        simplify development problems in daily production operations.

SPECIAL FUNCTION

    Automatic completion based on historical commands:

        Description:
            When the user types a command, the program automatically fills in
        the current input according to the typed string and the history input
        command,thereby reducing the user input and reducing the memory command,
        thereby improving the user's work efficiency.
            
            Whenever the user starts typing, two threads are opened, one for 
        receiving the user-entered string and the other for listening to the
        user's action on the keyboard.In this way,the function of automatically
        completing according to historical commands is completed.
            
            If the user does not press right key, the cursor flashes in the user
        input string and the auto-completion string.Pressing enter key directly
        indicates that the user input has ended and does not require automatic
        completion of the content;If the user presses right key after automatic
        completion,the user needs to automatically complete the content.At this
        time,the cursor flashes after the string is automatically completed,that
        is,at the end of the input line.
    
    Initial Method:
            Whenever the user presses the keyboard, the input string is matched
        with each line in the history input command file in the second thread,
        and the string is added to the input line, otherwise nothing is done.
        When the user input is finished, the user input is stored in the history
        command file.

    Later Method:
            In order to optimize performance,it is decided to use space for time.
        The reading of the history command file is only run once at the beginning
        of the program; the writing of the history command file is only run once
        before the end of the program. In the process of auto-completion, the
        original comparison with the historical command will no longer be used.
        The data structure of the tire is introduced here to optimize.

            Whenever the program runs, it is initialized internally, and each line
        of the command in the history command file is read into the trie in memory
        for storage. Whenever the user presses the keyboard,the matching process in
        the auto-completion is searched in the tire. Each time the user presses the
        enter key,the command is stored in trie and a linked list.Before the program
        exits, the commands entered during the running of the program in the linked
        list are stored in the history command file.

    hot key:

        Description:
            use Ctrl - [char].

            Ctrl - c    :   exit the program.(builtin command : exit)
